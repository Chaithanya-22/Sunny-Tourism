          <p>
            A man-made lake built during the Kakatiya Dynasty by the King
            Ganapati Deva in 1213 AD, it was made to serve the farmland
            activities. The creation of ancient times, even today, is seen
            performing its duty of providing water for irrigation. Approximately
            3 Lakh acres of land is surviving over its waters. This is the
            reason; one even spots a wide range of species of flora and fauna
            near the lake.
